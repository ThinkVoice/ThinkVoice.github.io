<p>Most Call Centers I have worked with measure customer satisfaction by survey.  At the end of an interaction a certain number of callers are asked to do a survey, or a customer service firm is tasked with doing a sampling of callers into the call center asking about their satisfaction.  While this is good data to have and statistically a good approach to measuring people's perception of your service it doesn't help you answer the more important question...</p>
<blockquote><p>"How is my service driving key business goals like acquisition, retention, referrals, and growth".</p></blockquote>
<p>For the following example let's assume you have a one year subscription or membership service.  Our hypothesis here is that if someone contacts you and gets great support when it comes time to renew they are more likely to sign back up for another year.  To prove that out pull up all the people who have contacted your call center and select out all but those people who contacted you within three months of their expiration date and who didn't call to explicitly cancel their service.  That list represents customers who have a fresh impression of the level of service that you provide and who have had to make a decision of whether your service was providing value enough to renew.  Now compare that population's renewal behavior against your entire customer population's renewal behavior and you will have a more true measure of customer satisfaction with your service.</p>
