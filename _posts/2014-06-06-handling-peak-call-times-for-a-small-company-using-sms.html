<p>Some businesses can operate in a feast or famine mode where demand is flat for a long period of time then some event occurs and the business sees a huge spike in demand. I recently had the misfortunate of experiencing this first hand and now know the basement waterproofing business is just one of these businesses.</p>
<p>I live in the Washington DC area which has had it's share of rain storms that produced a significant amount of water and one day I found some of it my basement. I, along with a large amount of people in the area, found out just how watertight my basement was (it wasn't). So I, like the others, got on Yelp, Angie's List, Home Advisor, etc to find the best person to help us out. I would say 80% of the services I called I had to leave a voicemail. Those that I got through to had long lead times but I could at least schedule someone coming out. This was two weeks ago. I just today had a call back from one company. The nice woman was surprised that this happened weeks ago and tried to assure me that she thinks they had tried calling in the past.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem of having the bandwidth to actually service customers during unusual peak demand is a hard problem to solve and I offer no solution to you the service providers in that predicament. But handling the customer communication is a very solvable problem. Using text messaging for your businesses allows you to be much more efficient with your communication. I as a customer am much more likely to have more frequent and shorter conversations with you via text to update you on the status of what I need. If we do have a conversation I am a whole lot more likely to put you in my address book. You as the business can use tools to consolidate that communication so that anyone in your office with a web browser can view the complete communication history and respond appropriately, but most importantly one person can respond to more than one customer at a time. My ten minute conversation with your receptionist isn't going to block out five other potential customers.</p>
<p>The customer communication problem is such an easy problem to fix. Please just let me text your business.</p>
