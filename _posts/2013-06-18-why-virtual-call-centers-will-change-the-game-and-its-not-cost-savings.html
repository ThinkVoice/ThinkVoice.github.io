<p>The advent of the cloud call center has opened a new oppurtunity for a large number of businesses that otherwise could not afford the expensive on premise PBX and CTI solutions. With SaaS offerings organizations can now pay for what they use and implement an entire call center with little need for IT resources. This is pretty early in the call center SaaS movement so we see the biggest abopters being small and mid size companies using the service as an oppurtunity to get this technology where they couldn't afford it before. If we look though at the CRM market and what Salesforce did we can predict that it will not just be a movement for small and mid size companies to get access to technology previously out of reach. We will soon see large companies moving to the on demand model to get more value out of their call center software.</p>
<h4>Looking Back</h4>
<p>Back when Salesforce was beginning the big incumbent was Siebel. Siebel was this massive software application that you spent a million dollars to buy then a million dollars to customize. In order to get it running you needed to bring in an IBM or PwC as a system integrator. They would come onsite for months at a time to install this hardware and software. All the while Salesforce was pressing on with their "No Software" mantra and the folks over at Siebel were saying, "Well that's fine for small and medium size business but no way our customers are going to put there customer information on someone else's servers". Fast forward to today where Oracle owned Siebel is desperately trying to catch up to the cloud model. Their customers are now Salesforce customers. No one wants to spend millions of dollars to install old stale software.</p>
<blockquote><p>It's the idea that quality can be improved not by specific project or mandate but by ongoing iterative improvement.</p></blockquote>
<p>Even today when I talk to some call center software providers I hear them say those famous last words, "our customers are big and have their own infrastructure, they don't want to do cloud". Call center software and infrastructure is not entirely equivalent to a CRM system. It's complex and expensive but you generally don't see the huge installation and customization projects that you saw in the CRM space of the early 2000's. Setting up a call center infrastructure is capital and labor intensive but generally it's pretty straight forward. You need to deliver calls to agents. So for a big company that can afford it, setting up a call center is not the biggest pain they are facing and thus the value that an on demand or cloud based call center brings is not something that is a must have to eliminate that pain. My theory though is that as time goes on the value proposition of the cloud call center will change and move up the value chain from being the cost savings driver today to driving better sales and service through integrated data in the future.</p>
<h4>A New Approach</h4>
<p>The idea of running a data driven contact center is the ability to use data to respond to service and sales needs by using data to evaluate what works, what doesn't work, and what can be changed to improve. It's the idea that quality can be improved not by specific project or mandate but by ongoing iterative improvement. Executing this idea of a data driven contact center though requires the right data. In a traditional call center infrastructure the data lives in the telepone switch…who called, what agent answered, was the call transferred, to who, how long did the customer wait, etc. This data is used operationally in a silo to mange the call center: do we have the right amount of agents, can we have them talk on the phone less and reduce handle time, can we measure first call resolution. It's managed in a silo because the data exists in that silo. What if it didn't have to exist in that silo. What if the data lived with the rest of your organization's data. What if callers could be tracked through every other inbound/outbound channel so you could start asking and answering questions such as why are people calling, why do certain folks repsond better than others to outbound calls, does our self service strategy drive better sales and service or just reduced cost, are customers who call more or less likely to churn, does our email campaign drive inbound tele-sales.</p>

<h4>Getting the Technology Out of the Way</h4>
<p>If we start spending less time and effort on call center technology we will start spending more time on smarter call center management where management is more than just average handle time. To get there though we need to start asking the right questions, and getting the data to support answering those questions through iterative experiments. Iterative experiments require implementing a tight Build, Measure, Learn feedback loop that has the least amount of friction within the cycle. That means less changes in multiple places, more connected data, less tightly integrated points that can fail, and more automation. It's these concepts that will drive bigger companies to the cloud call center, to the idea that simplicity is not just a cost saver but a value generator.</p>
