<p>#fail happens.  We just recently had our DNS provider, dnsimple, get hit with a massive denial of service attack bringing us down along with a slew of other sites.  We run our apps on a fantastic PaaS, Heroku, that allows us to have affordable redundancy but when this attack hit dnsimple it took down the whole front door to that redundancy.  Even with their own redundancy dnsimple wasn't able to withstand the attack so requests to our servers could not be handled. Our phone and SMS services are built on top of Twilio and during this outage Twilio was up and running.   As people dialed our numbers or sent us texts Twilio would try to forward those on to us but couldn't get through due to the DNS outage. For SMS messages we could could easily see those messages in the Twilio interface and handle those appropriately but phone calls are a real time synchronous process...someone is on the other end of the phone waiting for us to pick up!  Luckily we had a redundant solution in place that did not rely on our DNS provider.  We used Twimlets to redirect to calls.   <br />

<h2>Here is what you need to do to use Twimlets</h2>
<ol>
<li>Decide how you want to route calls in an emergency.  Do you want to call <a href="https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/forward" target="_blank">one phone</a>, many phones<a href="https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/simulring" target="_blank"> at once</a>,  many phones <a href="https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/findme" target="_blank">in order</a>, take a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/voicemail" target="_blank">voicemail</a>, or do you just want to play a <a href="https://www.twilio.com/labs/twimlets/message" target="_blank">down message</a>?</li>
<li>When provisioning the number through the UI or the API be sure to set the Voice fallback URL to your twimlet url and the method to GET.  When doing this through the API via POST to /IncomingPhoneNumbers the parameters are VoiceFallbackUrl and VoiceFallbackMethod.  If doing this for other customers be sure to keep the URL parameters up to date with any other forwarding decisions you are doing in your app.</li>
</ol>
<p>For those using Twilio already I hope this helps.  If you have any other questions about how we use Twilio please <a title="Contact" href="//thinkvoice.net/sign-up/">contact us</a>.</p>
