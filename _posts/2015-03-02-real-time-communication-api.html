In reading through the comments on <a title="HN API not IPO" href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9083324">hacker news</a> I saw the CEO of Twilio Jeff Lawson comment that's it's all about the API and not the IPO. While this may be have just been a pun I wanted to dig a little more into why I think this is right on and why it is all about the API especially for real time communication.</p>
<p>Twilio itself is just an API. Other than an account portal there is no user interface. It's not a standalone product you would buy and install, it's not a SaaS product that you would use standalone. It's not a phone switch either on premise or in the cloud. It is just an API and that makes all the difference as it can only be piece of something else.</p>
<h2>Real time communication as a (micro)service</h2>
<p>Real time communication both voice and messaging has traditionally been a standalone platform and until recently has been a hardware platform. While we are now moving away from hardware only you typically see even the software version of this as a standalone platform. Being all about the APIs means that we can integrate real time communication directly into the data that serves as context for these conversations. The CRMs, billing systems, business intelligence solutions are really the heart of any communication we have with customers. By pulling communication into these systems rather then pulling these systems into our communication channel we can provide much better context to those talking to customers. We have much more data in which to measure effectiveness of communication, and we can be much more agile in making changes to our systems to improve communication. Being all about the API means implementing just enough technology so it doesn't get in the way.</p>
<h2>When It's not about the API</h2>
<p>Having an API bolted onto monolithic application is not being all about the API. When standing up your real time communication channels whatever time and effort spent in anything but the context given to the agent to communicate effectively is wasted effort and going to make it harder for you down the line. So please, as you evaluate how to best communicate with your customers start with the data and work your way out. I think you will find it easier to bring that communication channel into the data as it's all about the API.</p>
