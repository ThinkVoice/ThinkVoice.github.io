<p>Think back to 1999 and what work life was if you are old enough.  </p>
<p>For me it was traveling the country week to week implementing call centers for very large organizations.  I had my IBM Global Dialer where I could pull up a list of local numbers on my laptop, dial in, hear those tones of my modem and download my mail (I didn't even have to worry about the per min charge to be on the Internet!).  When I got to a client site my portion of the work was usually pretty much the same. My job was to make the IVR talk to the backend system so callers could do self service tasks.  Each project was roughly the same.  I would write a C program that could get to a mainframe COBOL application, an MQ transaction system, or a SQL database.  We would install the IVR next to these systems in the datacenter, I would get the IP address, some credentials and in no time have an automated IVR solution that would pay for itself in months.</p>
<blockquote><p>We will bring the very technologies, philosophies, and techniques that have fueled this phenomenal Internet innovation to todayâ€™s contact centers in order to deliver a better customer experience.</p></blockquote>
<p>Now think of all that has happened since then.  If 1999 Brian showed up to implement your 2013 IVR he would do the exact same thing with just 3 little differences: no modem, no installation, and web services instead of SQL.  Think of all the innovation since 1999...Google, Twitter, Pets.com...and that is all we have improved in the call center space.  </p>
<p>The time for innovation and change is now though.  We will bring the very technologies, philosophies, and techniques that have fueled this phenomenal Internet innovation to today's contact centers in order to deliver a better customer experience.  We will build platforms that are constantly learning, constantly improving, constantly gathering data to make better decisions because we now can.  The innovation will come now because we can spend our energies designing better customer experiences rather than technology solutions.</p>
<p>The Innovation is here and now.</p>
