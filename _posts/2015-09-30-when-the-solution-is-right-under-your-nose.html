<p>At ThinkVoice a big part of what we do is call center technology consulting.  We are fortunate enough to have the unique expertise around what it takes to integrate data and voice in the pursuit of efficient customer relationship management, whether that be through sales or support.  In the industry we call this Computer Telephony Integration (CTI).  While it's great for us to have this unique and niche in demand skill, the fact is with the latest innovations in this space the niche is gone and most all of our customers have instantly inherited these skills and most don't even know it.</p>

<p>Just recently I was talking to a client walking through their needs to expand the channels of communication they offer to their customers and as we got to walking through the technology they have in place I was amazed to find the leading edge web technologies and best practices they had in place.  In looking at the application they had developed for agent facing interactions it was crystal clear to me that they a.) had an excellent handle on their own business process needs and b.) had the technical expertise to deliver it.  However, as the Director of Technology proudly finishes boasting, rightfully so, of this great technology the disclaimer gets thrown out... "but we are not telephony or CTI experts".  Now this is where we come in.  This is what we are experts in!  Unfortunately this is no longer the case.  My wonderful client has all of his CTI solutions right under his nose.  My wonderful client doesn't really ned me if they just ditch the old, antiquated, and closed systems they use to communicate with customers.</p>
<p>I am really excited to officially launch our Twilio Integration services offering so that we can help bridge these customer communication needs with the skills and technologies already in place.    Check out our new Twilio Integration Services offering and let us know how we can help you bridge the gap.</p>
