<p>Every customer I have ever had dreaded the software release cycle for their call center software.  Whether it's an IVR or Agent Desktop each release causes problems.  In more mature and larger organizations problems may not make it to the customer facing production system but the problem is it takes an enormous amount of resources to plan, implement, test, and deploy changes.</p>
<blockquote><p>The answer then is to reduce the time and scope of your releases and automate everything that can be automated.</p></blockquote>
<p>You do these software releases because they introduce new value into your call center whether it be through new customer/agent facing improvements, better analytics or reporting, or just fixing bugs that cause you problems.  Each resource you need to get this value deployed increases the cost and grinds away at the net value.  In addition to increasing the straight cost to the value of your particular release you are also  introducing an opportunity cost as the more resources you must pour into this one release means less resources for other value adding initiatives.</p>
<p>The larger the scope of each release then the longer it takes to implement.  The longer it takes to implement the more tasks have to be managed and coordinated between people.  The more coordination that has to happen between people the more meetings have to take place.  The more meetings that have to happen the more time is wasted.  The more time is wasted the less work is done.  The less work is done the less quality software can be deployed to your call center.</p>
<p>The answer then is to reduce the time and scope of your releases and automate everything that can be automated.  The idea of continuous deployment is not new for web software development.  There are plenty of resources available to get you started but the first step is buying into the idea, recognizing the waste in your release cycle, and setting a big goal of eliminating that waste.</p>
