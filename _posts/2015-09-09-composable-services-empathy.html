<p>It's been four months since I attended the Twilio Signal Conference. The videos of the sessions and keynotes have been released <a href="https://www.twilio.com/signal/2015/videos">here</a>.</p>
<p>I have always been a huge fan of Twilio not only for the great product they put out but the idea behind the company which is that we have the power to build the technology we want. We are no longer constrained by closed physical hardware nor by crappy prepackaged software. I wrote about this after coming back from the last <a href="/why-i-went-to-twiliocon-2013/">Twilio Conference</a> now three years ago.</p>

<p>This year's conference was no different in theme but the strategy to get there was really well laid out and I took away from that conference two main ideas: Composable Services and Empathy. The whole idea behind the conference and Twilio's entire product roadmap centers around this idea of composable services. What to me started with a confusing release of various products (TaskRouter, Monitor, Elastic SIP Trunking) really led to a holistic strategy of providing all the key pieces of communication services and allowing us, the builders, to string them together as we need to fit our needs and requirements. Composable services is not a new idea and maybe just the new SOA but check out Dr Werner Vogels talk about composable services <a href="https://youtu.be/4QXZl4cFw24?t=1730" target="_blank">here</a>, it's for real.</p>
<p>The other thing that stuck with me from the conference is this idea of Empathy and it came from a completely unrelated conversation about hiring engineers started by Eric Ries in an odd roundtable. In that exchange Harper Reed talked about the importance of Empathy as we deal with users and...well everybody.  You should really watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/gs378l1rXSU?t=2217" target="_blank">segment</a></p>
<p>I immediately thought back to how many IT meeting I have been in where we bemoan the needy business users and say things like "well this industry standard software package has 80% of everything they need" or my favorite "our business is not that different, we just need to follow the industry standard practices". We say these things because listening to and getting really good solutions in place is hard... or has been hard. We are scarred by the hugely over budget over time custom development disasters we have put ourselves and our users through in the past. We are scarred but undeterred by the hugely over budget over time package implementations of the past because this time we are going drag those users through our way.</p>
<p>But what about now...As the ability to build solutions ourselves becomes easier, as we learn to build iteratively, as we have the foundational building blocks of these solutions as a service we can now go back to listening to users to understand their problems and approach solutions from an empathetic place.</p>
