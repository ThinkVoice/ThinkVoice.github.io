For those not familiar with Twilio they are a telephony and SMS API provider allowing any developer to quickly integrate voice and messaging into their applications. Twilio was started five years ago and their growth has been unbelievable. They are now processing over 4 million calls every single day up from 1.5 million last year and 300,000 in 2011! I went to TwilioCon though to see first hand the innovation that is now possible in a telcom world that has not seen any innovation in the past 15 years and I was not disappointed.</p>
<p>Twilio CEO Jeff Lawson talks about everything now moving into the domain of "software people". The most exciting opportunities right now, the place where the most innovation is happening, is where we are taking what have traditionally been hardware or physical world problems and turning them into software problems. Solutions to hardware or physical world problems are generally restricted by physical interfaces and do not allow for quick feedback based iteration. Software solutions however have no limitation on physical space, cost nothing to change and deploy, and can easily be built on top of, or integrate with, other platforms to further increase agility. The physical to software story has already been told with Retail-&gt; Amazon.com, Blockbuster-&gt;Netflix, data centers-&gt; Amazon AWS, hailing a cab-&gt;Uber. With each iteration the software becomes more aware while the hardware becomes more obsolete.</p>
<p>Twilio is software enabling the telephone and we the software people now have the opportunity to absolutely transform what has traditionally been a hardware problem to a software problem. From a call center software perspective this now means that we can get rid of all the hardware in the closet that powers the phones, it means that we can rid of the hardware and software that makes up all the CTI that integrates our data and phone calls, most importantly though it means we now have the chance to develop truly amazing customer experiences since we the software people have the same access to data and agility that all those like Amazon and Netflix that have gone before us have provided.</p>
<p>It's now up to our imagination of what we build and how we solve problems that we have lived with and taken as status quo. There is no limitation. This is why I went to TwilioCon 2013 and why I started ThinkVoice. We are proud to be a Twilio <a href="https://www.twilio.com/showcase/thinkvoice">partner</a>.</p>
