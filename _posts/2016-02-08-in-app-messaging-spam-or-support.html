<h3>What is In-App Messaging?</h3>
<p>In-app Messaging allow you to engage with your customers right where they are in your app depending on exactly what they are doing.  Notice a user getting stuck in your upgrade flow?  See your user's credit card will expire next month?  In-app Messaging allows you to present a helpful nudge or link to your customer within your app instead of pushing out an email and hoping they act.</p>
<p>In-App messaging can be much more than just a replacement for transactional or marketing email though.  Intelligent In-App Messaging can be a bridge to very valuable customer interactions that allow you and your team to learn from and delight customers.  Intelligent In-App Messaging not only knows when a customer is in need of help within your app, it knows who on your team can help that customer and bridges the two.</p>


<h3>Implementing In-App Messaging</h3>
<p>Here are two key questions to consider when thinking about what customer experience you are delivering with In-App Messaging.</p>
<h4>Do You Want to Engage with Users via In-App Messaging?</h4>
<p>Do you want users to be able to reply to your In-App Messages if something is not clear or if they are struggling with your app's flow?  Do you see In-app Messaging as way to connect with customers?</p>
<h4>Can You Manage the Customers That Want to Communicate With You?</h4>
<p>If you do want to take the opportunity to engage with your customers then how are you going to guarantee a quality customer experience?  Can you control the messaging so that you can offer conversational In-app Messaging when you do have someone available to respond or be able to turn that off when no one can respond to a customer?  Do you have an existing support channel whether that be phone, email, or chat that you can plug your In-App Messaging into?</p>
<p>These are key questions to answer to ensure you are adding value with your In-App Messaging.  Implementing the right strategy with the right tools is probably easier than you think.</p>
