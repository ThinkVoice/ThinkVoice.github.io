<p><a href="https://twitter.com/MMeekerW">Mary Meeker</a> presented her Internet Trends for 2014 last week. Each year her report is a fantastic synopsis of what is happening on the Internet and this year was no exception. There are a few great stories in this report like how software is continuing to allow us to reimagine everyday life. What grabbed my attention though is explosive growth of smartphones and the change in our communication via messaging.</p>
<p>She lead the presentation off with a slide showing that now smartphone users make up 30% of total GLOBAL mobile phone users. That is a lot of people walking around with computers in their pocket. The theme is of course what Marc Andreessen has been been preaching for years that <a title="software is eating the world" href="//online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424053111903480904576512250915629460">software is eating the word</a>. With this increasing access and connectivity we are reimagining everyday life including how we message each other. On slide slide 36 she notes that the apps WhatsApp and Line alone do 10 BILLION messages per day and this has all been created in less than 5 years. She goes on to note that the communication trend is moving away from shouting out to the masses (Facebook) to "more frequent interactions with a smaller group of close contacts" which I would call real conversations. Imagine that!</p>
<p>So the people have spoken. We do want to communicate with each other. We want to do it on the keyboards of our smart phones. So why can't I text Comcast that my router is broken? I don't even want to call my friends to coordinate a meeting time what makes me want to call my plumber to do the same? Because I have to! I truly do want those I do business with, those that provide value to me, to be in my address book so I can communicate with them just as I do wit the rest of the world.</p>
<p>It's what we are helping to build at ThinkVoice. It's amazing to took at this presentation, at the numbers of devices that are being shipped, at the innovation that is being enabled.</p>
